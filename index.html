        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Government⚖️</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Yuening An earned her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University of California, Riverside. She earned her Juris Doctor degree from the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. Her research focuses on public, private, criminal, and special education law. She also served as a parent advocate at LegalAction, a law corporation to defend the rights of children with disabilities while pursuing her JD. Her renowned journal publications include Global Justice for Mass Atrocities and Genocide, Children and the Law, and Intellectual Property and Technology. Her book, How Children with Disabilities are Mistreated in Public Educational Systems (2025, USC Press), unravels the dark side of the U.S. public education system and analyzes how government regulations for public schools are ineffective. Dr. An’s research has been funded by the USC Gould School of Law, UC Irvine School of Law, Santa Clara University Public Policy Department, and the UCLA School of Law.<br><br>

        Dr. An has shown a passion for law from a very young age. As the daughter of a lawyer, she often heard her father talking on the phone to his clients whose children were mistreated in public schools and denied the educations they deserved – just because they had special needs. With every call, she realized how much the American dominant cultural framework privileges independence and ableism, and knew that she needed to help amplify the voices of vulnerable, marginalized, and historically underserved populations. The perception to realize how unbalanced the Scales of Justice is aspires her to be a lawyer. To better pave her way for entering the field of combating injustice, she realized that she must obtain profound knowledge of societal, political, and economic issues, and simultaneously develop her critical thinking skills. Accordingly, she was drawn to political science major in college and later step into law school with a broad understanding of how law systems work in the United States and the rest of the globe.<br><br>

        After Law School, Dr. An decided to narrow her interest to Children’s Law. She yearns to be a persecuted special education attorney and defend the interest of children with disabilities at public schools. She decides to file cases against the state government. Unlike other attorneys who charge their clients for hours, she will charge completely free for her clients, considering the fact that most of the special needs children come from low-income families. Instead, she will be charging the state governments whenever she wins a case based on a piece of law. Moreover, she will be involved in IEP meetings, which stand for Individualized Education Program. To create an effective IEP, she will be joining parents, teachers, other school staff, and the student to come together and look closely at the student's unique needs. She will use her extensive knowledge, experience, and commitment to help design an educational program that will help the student be involved in, and progress in, the general curriculum. She will guide the delivery of special education support and services for the student with a disability.
